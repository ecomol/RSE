# RSE
RSE is an R package for estimating the number of newly found rare species in additional ecological samples, 
based on species diversity information (abundance or incidence) in original ecological samples. 
The methods implemented in this R package include a Bayesian-weighted estimator and two unweighted estimators
All the estimators have been described in detail in the following paper:

Predicting the number of newly discovered rare species: a Bayesian weight approach. Under review in Conservation Biology (2018)


To install, please download the file RSE_1.0.tar.gz and save it into your local directory.
Open R software, and type the following command:

install.packages("your_local_directory/RSE_1.0.tar.gz",repos=NULL,type="source")

To use the RSE package in R, now load the package by typing the following command:

library(RSE)

After that the package has been loaded in R environment, for the assistance about each function and the associated demonstrating example, 
type the following command in R software (taking the function f.to.X() as an example):

?f.to.X


Further, readers are encouraged to download and read the R mannual for specific introductions about the function and the example demonstrated.
